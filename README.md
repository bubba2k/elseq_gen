# elseq_gen

This is a neat, small Python script that generates digital art in the style of The Designers Republics artwork for the Elseq Album by Autechre.
Using the Pillow library.

There is a config section at the top of the script file. Adjust those to whatever you want, then just run it. Outputs the Images to the same folder the script is in.
