# elseq_gen

(Note: This was one of the first pieces of code ive ever written and it shows.)

This is a small Python script that generates digital art in the style of The Designers Republics artwork for the Elseq Album by Autechre.
Using the Pillow library.

There is a config section at the top of the script file. Adjust those to whatever you want, then just run it. Outputs the Images to the same folder the script is in.
